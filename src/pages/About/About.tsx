            An Echo of the Heart is a creative space where I, Daniela García—writer, mother, and founder of Bespoken—share stories rooted in travel, motherhood, personal growth, and creative living. Born from a desire to connect and inspire, this blog captures the quiet truths of everyday life, inviting readers to pause, reflect, and reconnect with their inner world.

            Each post is an echo—one heart reaching gently toward many.

            Some years ago, as I slowed down and quieted my life, an inward and spiritual search sparked within me, deeper than ever before. I began connecting with the words of mentors, books, and inspiring people, while also learning to truly listen to my own thoughts and feelings. That quiet shift became a profound turning point in my life.
          </p>
          <p className='about__text' style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            Writing soon became my way of making sense of the changes — expressing inner transformation, motherhood, creativity, and the evolving nature of self. As I began sharing my reflections, I noticed something beautiful: a bridge was forming. My words were not just mine; they resonated with others, creating connection, understanding, and even healing. That's when I understood the quiet power of storytelling, and how one person's truth can echo outward and touch many.
          </p>
          <p className='about__text' style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            I never imagined how much joy, creativity, change, healing, and personal growth I would discover through writing and sharing.
          </p>
          <p className='about__text' style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            An Echo of the Heart is my evolving side project—an honest space for reflection, creativity, and presence. Here, I write freely and intuitively, exploring moments from motherhood, expat life, personal spirituality, and travel—alongside my creative business, Bespoken, which allows me to express beauty through handcrafted florals and gifts.
          </p>
          <p className='about__text' style={{ width: '100%' }}>
            Whether you're here to read, reflect, or simply take a breath, I hope this space feels like a soft landing. I'm not always consistent—as a mom and woman continually learning, I've embraced the ebb and flow. I return here when I can, letting go of perfection and taking each step slowly, with intention.
          </p>
          <p className='about__text' style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
            Thank you for being here. May something you read echo back into your own heart, reminding you to live gently, creatively, and fully.

        <p className='about__text' style={{ margin: 0 }}>
          <p style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>I'm Dany García! Welcome to this online space where I love to write, tell stories and share of some of my work.</p>
          <p>I was born in Colombia, raised for a few years in the US, have lived a decade of life in Argentina with a few trips in the middle, and now live way up north in Scandinavia. I am momma to little Benja, wife to Guille and owner of our little Jack Russell, Indie.</p>
          <p>I have adventured around the world quite a lot and have come through many stages of a young adult's life. I've always been a person who likes to celebrate life and moments, to dance, and to get together with friends and family. My career, Hospitality Management, was chosen out of true vocation, and I worked for hotels and private companies within guest and employee services. I look back and tend to smile, remembering all the learning experiences and that heartwarming feeling of having been connected to so many people.</p>
          <p>After that, I started my dream business in Buenos Aires called Bespoken. I had embraced my creativity for crafted adornments, gifts and flowers. Fast-forward two years, and life brought us to Sweden, with my main job as a full-time mom. Talk about BIG changes. Embracing changes and new learnings, sharing bits of my life as I go through them, and then writing about them is part of my expression and the way I connect with others. And as I write and share content, I grow, too.</p>
          <p>Change is always a constant; it is part of life, and we are never the same, but at the same time, we hold in ourselves everything we will ever be. Like a little oak seed holding the potential of becoming a big oak tree, it's in us all the time. My goal is to reach every day my full acceptance and of others, to be fearless, to be true and gentle to myself, and to live in freedom and greatness.</p>
          <p>We tend to do what other people are doing, and it is easy to fall into comparison or doubt about our own selves and our work, but as Marshall Rosenberg said, this blocks you from compassion towards yourself and others. Compassion is to observe without judgement.</p>
          <p>It took me some years to get this website project moving until I finally understood:</p>
          <p><strong>1)</strong> Things can be done at your own pace; there is no need to rush. Go one day at a time, with little steps accompanying.</p>
          <p><strong>2)</strong> Everything in life is to be enjoyed, not valued. A key to truly living life in a very present way.</p>
          <p><strong>3)</strong> You can get inspired by others, but at the end, the key is to be yourself and appreciate your unique touch. Everything you will ever be lies within you, as it lies in everyone around you.</p>
          <p><strong>4)</strong> Daily forgiveness is key to keeping going and reaching higher and more powerful grounds.</p>
          <p>I hope you enjoy reading and, while you are at it, can get Inspired, Aware and Creative with your own life and talents. It is never too late to start looking inside of You.</p>
          <p>With love,</p>
          <p>Dany</p>
